//! Integration tests for the collision runners' public API.
//!
//! These need a reasonably uniform PRNG: the tradeoff buffer is sized assuming
//! points spread ~evenly over the 2^(t·b) passes. A degenerate generator (e.g.
//! incr, which maps every point to cell 0) would overflow it, so the file is
//! gated to splitmix.
